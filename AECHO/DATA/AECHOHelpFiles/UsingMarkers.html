    AECHO provides four <b>Marker </b>buttons, which are used to
    bookmark locations within a loaded ODF. These bookmarks remain in
    place until individually changed, until reset as a group (<b>menu
      &gt; </b><b><u>T</u></b><b>ools &gt; </b><b>C</b><b>lear Markers</b>),


    or until the ODF is closed: Markers are not retained once an ODF has
    been closed or AECHO has terminated. These four buttons are only
    enabled while an ODF is loaded. They are located at the bottom of
    the Data Panel, just beneath the Section, Line, and Row data.<br>
    <br>
    Markers that are not set display their original text ("<b>Marker
      1/2/3/4</b>") as seen here. Left-clicking on an unset <b>Marker </b>has


    no effect.<br>

    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"

    <b>Markers </b>are set by right-clicking once on the button,
    thereby assigning it the line number where the Cursor/Caret is
    presently located: this is also the same value as displayed in the
    Data Panel's <b>Line Number</b> field at the moment of the
    right-click. When set, the <b>Marker </b>displays the bookmarked
    line number on the button's face, against a pale-blue background.
    Left-clicking on a set <b>Marker </b>will position the
    Cursor/Caret to the beginning of the bookmarked line, using single
    mouse-click semantics: the <b>Caret Position</b>, <b>Line Number</b>,
    <b>Line Start</b>, <b>Line End</b>, <b>Row Start</b>, and <b>Row
      End</b> fields are updated, but the Section is not updated, no
    text is selected, and the contents of the XML Row/Record Area and
    Tags Panel remain unchanged. In the following example, on the left
    picture, <b>Marker 1</b> has been set to Line 58, and <b>Marker 4</b>
    to Line 269: setting <b>Marker 4</b> was the last operation
    performed, and the Data Panel still shows "269" as the current <b>Line

      Number</b>. The right-side picture shows the state after
    left-clicking on <b>Marker 1 ("58")</b>, thereby repositioning the
    Cursor/Caret: note the updates to the Caret, Line, and Row
    information, while the Section data remains unchanged, even though
    the new position is located in a different Section of the ODF.<br>
