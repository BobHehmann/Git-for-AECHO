    <br>
    The ODF Display Area is AECHO's operational hub: it is here that ODF
    content is displayed in its entirety, can be edited, and
    Rows/Records can be selected for analysis, presenting their
    individual Fields and those Field's values.<br>
    <br>
    An ODF XML File is simply a text file, containing no formatting
    information beyond the use of white-space and line-breaks: it does
    not have any particular font, nor any of the attributes associated
    with a font, such as size, typeface, color, or emphasis - all such
    presentation details are left to a text editor. AECHO displays all
    of the body-text of an ODF in a single font, 10-points in size,
    normal weight, colored black. Section Start-Tags (Titles) are given
    special emphasis, by increasing their font-size by 1 point, coloring
    them blue, and setting their weight to Bold. All white-space and
    line-breaks are presented exactly as they are in the file: AECHO
    does not introduce soft line-breaks in the ODF Display Area, nor
    does it introduce indentation based on the XML structural content.<br>
    <br>
    Using the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="ControlODFFontSize.html"><font
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">ODF Font
            Size</font></b></font></a> control, the user can set the
    body text's font-size to any value ranging from 7-points to
    20-points (Section Titles will display at 8-point to 21-points.)<br>
    <br>
    When saving an ODF back out as a file, it is written as simple text,
    without any formatting information. AECHO reads and writes files
    assuming UTF-8 encoding, which is required by the Hauptwerk ODF XML
    specification: this allows the easy inclusion of special-characters
    into text strings, such as language-specific accent marks. The user
    can simply paste-in desired special characters, copied from the text
    editor of their choice.<br>
    <br>
    The ODF Display Area is normally read-only: text may be freely
    selected and copied using standard mouse and keyboard operations,
    but cannot be pasted, deleted, or altered in any other way. However,
    the user can enable editing by selecting <b>menu &gt;<font
        size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></b><font
      size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><u>E</u></b></font><b><font
        size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">dit Mode</font>
      &gt;&nbsp;<font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></b><font
      face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1"><a
            moz-do-not-send="true" href="MenuEditMode.html">ODF Editing
          </a><a moz-do-not-send="true" href="MenuEditMode.html">Enabled</a></font></b></font>
    from the Menu-Bar, after which all the standard operating system
    functions for changing text become available, such as pasting,
    deleting, typing, and over-typing text.<br>
    <br>
    The ODF Display Area presents both vertical and horizontal
    scroll-bars, as needed. If some lines of text within the ODF are
    longer that the available width of the area at the current font-size
    setting, the horizontal scroll-bar is displayed, regardless of
    whether or not any of the long lines are currently onscreen. AECHO
    never word-wraps long text lines in this display area.<br>
    <br>
    Single-clicking at a spot in the ODF positions the visible
    Cursor/Caret to that point, updating the position information found
    in the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="AreaDataPanel.html"><font
        size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Data Panel Area</b></font></a>.
    Selecting text will do the same, with the Cursor/Caret position
    determined by the direction of the selection: if from left-to-right,
    the Cursor/Caret will be considered to be just to the right of the
    selected text; if from right-to-left, just to the left of the
    selected text. Note that these operations do not select nor analyze
    the Row/Record, nor do they update the Section position or the
    Section description, even if the new Cursor/Caret position is now in
    a different Section than before. Any position in the ODF may be
    safely single-clicked.<br>
    <br>
    Double-clicking at a spot does all of the above, plus it selects the
    entire Row (1 or more Lines, depending on the content), copies the
    selected Row to the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="AreaXMLRowRecord.html"><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
        sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">XML Row/Record Area</font></b></font></a>,
    updates the current Section name and position, and loads the
    matching Section description into the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="AreaDescriptiveText.html"><font size="-1" face="Helvetica,
        Arial, sans-serif"><b>Descriptive Text Area</b></font></a>. If
    the Row is of type "Record" (bounded by '&lt;o&gt;...&lt;/o&gt;'
    Tags), is is broken down into its constituent Fields onto the <a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="AreaTagsPanel.html"><font size="-1"
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Tags Panel</b></font></a>,
    and the values of those Fields are displayed alongside the
    short-names of the Tags. Any position in the ODF may be safely
    double-clicked.<br>
    <br>
    The current position can be advanced or retarded by 1, 10, or 100
    Lines at a time using any of the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="ButtonsNextPrevLine.html"><font size="-1" face="Helvetica,
        Arial, sans-serif"><b>Next Ln</b></font>, <font size="-1"
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Prev Ln</b></font>, <font
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">&gt; 10 L</font></b></font>,
      <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">&lt;
            10 L</font></b></font>, <font size="-1" face="Helvetica,
        Arial, sans-serif"><b>&gt; 100 L</b></font>, or <font
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">&lt; 100
            L</font></b></font></a> buttons. These buttons select the
    new Line/Row, just like a double-click, so Section and descriptive
    information will be appropriately updated. These six controls
    position the Cursor/Caret at the beginning of the new Line. If the
    Row has multiple Lines, the <font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
      sans-serif"><b>Next Ln</b></font> and <b><font size="-1"
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Prev Ln</font></b> buttons
    will step through the Row one Line at a time: the entire Row will
    remain selected as you step through it, but the current Line
    Cursor/Caret positioning information will be visibly updated. These
    positioning buttons are bounded by the beginning and the end of the
    ODF - they do not advance past those boundaries, do not wrap-around.<br>
