    The <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Data

          Panel Area</font></b></font> displays position information for
    the current ODF and any selection. There are eight primary position
    fields, which are also hyperlinks to their locations: clicking on
    one of these colored fields will move the cursor to that location,
    without selecting a Row nor changing the Section - similar to a
    single mouse-click on the position displayed in the field. If a
    Record-Row is currently selected, this area displays the number of
    Fields/Tags found in that Record. Lastly, the four <font
      face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Marker</font></b></font>
    buttons are located in this area, allowing bookmarks to be set and
    used.<br>

      <dd>Identifie<font size="+1"><b>s</b></font> the character
        positions of the start and the end of the current Section. Start
        is defined as the first character of the first Line of the
        Section, the "<font size="+1" color="#3366ff"><b>&lt;</b></font>"
        bracket that opens the Section's Start-Tag. End is defined as
        immediately following the closing "<font size="+1"
          color="#3333ff"><b>&gt;</b></font>" bracket of the Section's
        End-Tag. Clicking on <font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
          sans-serif"><b>Section Start</b></font> positions the
        Cursor/Caret at the beginning of the Line containing the
        Section's Title i.e., its Start-Tag. Clicking on <font
          face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Section
              End</font></b></font> positions to the end of the Line
        with the Section's End-Tag.</dd>

      <dt><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Line

      <dd>The number of the Line where the Cursor/Caret is currently
        positioned. This value is one-based i.e., the first line in the
        ODF is <font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Line

            Numbe</b></font>r 1. As Lines are never soft-wrapped in the
        <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="AreaODF.html"><font
            face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">ODF
                Display Area</font></b></font></a>, the numbers
        displayed by AECHO will generally correspond with those assigned
        by many common text editors, such as Notepad++. Clicking this
        field will position to the beginning of the Line.</dd>

      <dt><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Caret

              Position</font></b></font></dt>
      <dd>The character position of the Cursor/Caret's present location.
        This value is zero-based i.e., when placed in front of the first
        character of the ODF, its value will be 0. The invisible
        line-break character at the end of each line is included in the
        count. Character positions are always based on the simple-text:
        they do not include any hidden Rich-Text formatting. Similar to
        <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Line

              Number</font></b></font>, this field will closely
        correspond to the positions reported back by common text
        editors. Clicking on this field will restore the visibility of
        the Cursor, without moving it: the Cursor/Caret is usually
        hidden when the <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font
              size="-1">ODF Display Area</font></b></font> loses focus,
        so this lets the user restore it without risking moving the
        position.</dd>

        All other Row types are found on a single Line, in which case
        the values displayed here will match those of their respective <font

        counterparts. Clicking on one of these fields will position the
        Cursor/Caret to either the beginning of the first Line of the
        Row, or to the end of the last Line of the Row.</dd>

      <dd>The four <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font
              size="-1">Marker</font></b></font> buttons are found in
        this area. They allow the user to set up to four bookmarks,
        which are pointers to the starting positions of bookmarked
        Lines. These buttons, once set, can be used to reposition the <b><font
            size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">ODF Display
            Area</font></b> and the Cursor/Caret position to the
        selected bookmark. See <a moz-do-not-send="true"

        description of their use.</dd>

      <dd>The small colored box found at the upper-right corner of this
        area provides a simple report on the status of scanning &amp;
        listing the Sections, which can take some time for a very large
        ODF. This control is colored orange when there is no ODF loaded;
        green when an ODF is loaded but AECHO is not scanning; red when
        a scan is in progress. It is not a clickable control.</dd>

    <p>Example: In the following example, a single Record-Row, three
      Lines long, was selected. In each case, the only difference is
      that the Cursor/Caret is successively positioned to the first
      character of the first of the three Lines, then the second, and
      lastly the third. Notice how the data changes: in the first
      example, the <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font
            size="-1">Line Start</font></b></font> is the same as the <font
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Row Start</font></b></font>,
      and the Caret is located there; in the second, the <font
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Line
            Number</font></b></font> is advanced by one, the <font
        size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Line Start/End</b></font>
      is wholly between the outer Row boundaries, and the Caret is
      located at that Line's beginning; lastly, the <font
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Line End</font></b></font>
      is the same as the <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font
            size="-1">Row End</font></b></font>, the <font
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Line
            Number</font></b></font> is one greater again, and the Caret
      is located at the beginning of that Line.<br>
