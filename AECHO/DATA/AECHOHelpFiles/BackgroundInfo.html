    HauptwerkÂ® instruments are comprised of numerous resources:
    individual sounds (Samples), numerous images, and very importantly,
    the ODF (Organ Definition Format/File), a formatted file that
    instructs HW how to marshal those resources into a functioning
    virtual instrument. The ODF contains encoded information defining
    all the instrument's behaviors, its on-screen&nbsp; presentations,
    all of its controls and their operation, how sound is processed and
    presented...: every detail of the instrument.<br>
    <br>
    Purveyors of HW instruments sometimes encrypt their ODFs prior to
    distribution: the information in these encrypted ODFs is protected
    by HW, and is not readable by AECHO, or by other common file
    editors.<br>
    <br>
    However, many ODFs are distributed in a non-encrypted form, which
    can be read and edited by a human (at least, theoretically) using
    any common text editor, such as Notepad++. Internally, these files
    are encoded in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), a
    technology-industry standard for exchanging structured data in a
    self-defining, human-readable, technology-independent way. <a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="XMLIntro.html">To learn more about
      XML, click here</a>. A key concept in XML is that data is enclosed
    between pairs of markup "Tags", where the Tags help identify the
    meaning and purpose of the data item, and its relationship to other
    data.<br>
    <br>
    These non-encrypted ODFs come in two forms:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Full-ODF - contains expanded, meaningful, human-readable Tags,
        and includes representations of all data "Fields" within data
        "Records", even when those Fields are set to their HW-defined
        default values. For example, a Field in a Full-ODF might be
        represented by the XML-snippet:<br>
        <blockquote>&lt;InstallationPackageID&gt;1234&lt;/InstallationPackageID&gt;</blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>Compiled/Compressed-ODF - a highly compressed form, which
        substitutes 1-2 character short alphabetic Names e.g.,
        "&lt;d&gt;...&lt;/d&gt;" or "&lt;a1&gt;...&lt;/a1&gt;", for the
        longer meaningful Tag-Names of the Full-ODF. Compressed-ODFs do
        not contain explicit Fields/Tags at all for Fields whose values
        are set to their HW defaults. This compression greatly reduces
        the size of the ODF, and increases the speed with which it can
        be read and written. However, this comes at the expense of human
        understandability, as the Tag-Names carry no obvious meaning.
        For example, the prior Full-ODF Tag seen in the example above
        might appear in a Compressed-ODF as:<br>
        <blockquote>&lt;c&gt;1234&lt;/c&gt;<br>
        </blockquote>
        Why "&lt;c&gt;"? Probably at the time the correspondence was
        first defined in HW, this Tag was the third element of its
        Record. As newer versions of the ODF specification are
        implemented, some older Fields may be deprecated, while other
        newer Fields are added. Over time, these modifications can lead
        to gaps in the sequence of short-names, and sometimes to breaks
        in their alphabetical ordering: Over time, the current
        (hypothetical) ordering of Fields within a Record-Type might
        change from "&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;d&gt; &lt;e&gt;
        &lt;f&gt;" to "&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;d&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;h&gt;
        &lt;e&gt; &lt;f&gt;", "&lt;c&gt;" having been retired, while
        "&lt;g&gt;" and "&lt;h&gt;" were added.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Most instruments are distributed with their ODFs in this
      compressed form, and are therefore mostly opaque to the casual
      user. Professional and semi-pro instrument developers have access
      to a set of extended tools that allow the ODF data to be
      exported/imported in its Full form, and/or written to a database
      in a transparently equivalent format. However, the average casual
      user often does not have access to these tools. HW does provide a
      native facility called "Custom Organ Design Module" (CODM) for
      creating and editing simpler instruments. CODM operates on a
      simplified and reduced subset of the complete ODF specification,
      but does not implement the Full-ODF specification, and is not
      suitable for managing professionally created ODFs.<br>
    </p>
    AECHO partly fills in this gap between CODM and the Full-ODF
    specification: it can open and interpret Compiled/Compressed
    (non-encrypted!) ODFs, showing the user the correspondence between
    the compressed Tags and their long-form Full-ODF counterparts. It
    also allows for simple editing of this type of ODF. The screen-shot
    below shows an example, taken from HW's St. Anne's Moseley ODF. The
    large scrollable display area near the top-center of the screen is
    showing the text of the St. Anne's ODF as distributed.<br>
    <br>
    A particular line from this ODF has been selected (by a mouse
    double-click), which has extracted the entire content of the XML
    Record into the smaller display area titled "<b><font size="-1"
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">XML Row/Record</font></b>".
    AECHO defines a Row as a complete XML statement: most importantly,
    the content bounded between a start/end pair of
    "&lt;o&gt;...&lt;/o&gt;" Tags, which may be comprised of many lines
    of text. These Rows correspond closely to the concept of a database
    Record, with the database Table corresponding to the ODF Section,
    "ImageSetElement" in this demonstration. The Tags between the
    bounding "&lt;o&gt;...&lt;/o&gt;" ("a", "b", "c", and "d")
    correspond to database Fields in this Record. AECHO has recognized
    the Section we have positioned into ("<font size="-1"
      color="#ff0000" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>ImageSetElement</b></font>"),




    extracted the selected Row (Record), and loaded the long-form
    description of this record-type into the display area on the
    bottom-right, including the information that the Tag "&lt;b&gt;"
    would have a default value of "1", where it not explicitly present
    in this Record. On the bottom-left side of the window, AECHO has
    separated the Record into its Fields, showing each Fields's
    compressed-form Name alongside its Value. As this Row references an
    Image resource, AECHO is showing the <font size="-1"
      face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Display Image</b></font>
    button that would retrieve and display that Image on the screen, if
    the user wished to see it.<br>
    <br>
    AECHO is also showing position information about the selected
    Row/Line/Character: where its Parent Section begins and end in the
    file; the Line number; the current Cursor/Caret position; where the
    Line begins and ends; where the Row (same as the Line, in this
    example) begins and ends; how many unique Tags/Fields ("4") are
    present in this Record.<br>
    <br>
    AECHO provides several navigation tools, including text searches in
    either direction. Continuing searches can be performed from the
    point of the last successful search, or from any other point in the
    ODF by single-clicking at that point before doing a <font size="-1"
      face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Find Next</b></font> or <font
      size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Find Prev</b></font>.
    AECHO also allows positioning by advancing or retreating a line at a
    time, 10 lines at a time, or 100 lines at a time. Clicking on any
    one of the eight colored Position-Data fields immediately moves the
    Cursor/Caret to that point in the ODF.<br>
    <br>
    The user can set up to four <b>Markers</b>, by right-clicking one
    of the <font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Marker</b><b>
        x</b></font> buttons, which will then associate the current Line
    with that <b>Marker</b>. Left-clicking an assigned <b>Marker</b>
    relocates to that point in the ODF. Any of the 44 defined ODF
    Sections can be directly accessed by selecting the desired Section
    from one of the two <font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
      sans-serif"><b>Sections</b></font> pull-down menus found on the
    Menu-Bar.<br>
    <br>
    AECHO provides two support tools that open in their own windows: a
    tool to translate back-and-forth between ODF Coupler-Codes and their
    natural-language descriptions; a tool to Trace a (sound) Sample
    Record, extracting all its Fields and following links to other
    Section-Records that are connected to the Sample, fully expanding
    their Field content also. This Trace function is also accessible
    from the main window: when the ODF is positioned to a Sample record,
    AECHO displays the <font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
      sans-serif"><b>Trace Sample</b></font> button, that can perform a
    Trace on the selected Record.<br>
