    <br>
    AECHO installs an extensive set of descriptive text for the 44
    standard ODF Sections, plus other non-Section content areas: this
    text reflects the ODF specification current as of Hauptwerk V6.x,
    documenting all known Fields for all Sections, both their short and
    long-form Field-Tags, default values, and obsolete Tags. This
    content may be modified by the user i.e. custom notes may be made
    and saved.<br>
    <br>
    Note that care must be taken if modifying this content: presently,
    AECHO makes no attempt to identify and protect custom modifications,
    and a subsequent installation, re-installation, or update to AECHO
    will overwrite any user mods, without warning. A future release of
    AECHO may help protect user content.<br>
    <br>
    AECHO stores its Section descriptions in discrete RTF files, one for
    each Section. The files are named the same as their related Section
    i.e., the descriptive text file for the Section TextInstance is
    "TextInstance.rtf". The location of these files depends on the type
    of AECHO installation:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Non-installed AECHO: AECHO was not installed by the system,
        but was simply extracted from a compressed distribution file. In
        this installation, AECHO's descriptive files are in the
        directory "\DATA\", located in the same directory/folder as
        AECHO's executable. For example, if the executable is
        "C:\Somewhere\AECHO\AECHO.exe", then the descriptive files will
        be in "C:\Somewhere\AECHO\DATA\". Saved user mods are written
        back to these data files, overwriting their original content,
        which are in turn subject to being overwritten if AECHO is
        redeployed into the same directory.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Installed AECHO, "Just Me" mode: this is the default
        installation type when AECHO is installed by running its
        setup.exe or AECHOInstaller.msi installer program. In this
        version of an installation, there is a single copy of the data
        files, located in the installing user's Roaming AppData
        directory. This location varies somewhat by operating system
        version. For Windows10, it is<br>
        <br>
        "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\AECHO\DATA\".<br>
        <br>
        When AECHO is uninstalled, the sub-directory \AECHO\ and all its
        content is deleted, which would also delete any user-made
        modification, if precautions outside of AECHO have not been
        taken. A re-installation of AECHO will overwrite the directory,
        also deleting any user mods as it refreshes the data files.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Installed AECHO, "Everyone" mode: this is an option when
        installing AECHO from its setup.exe or AECHOInstaller.msi
        program. In this type of installation, every user gets their own
        private copy of the data. The system stores a baseline copy in a
        hidden system area, and immediately installs an instance of that
        data in the installing-user's Roaming AppData directory, in the
        same place as a "Just Me" installation. Any modifications made
        by the installing user are to this local copy, not affecting
        other users, or the baseline. For other users, the first time
        they run AECHO, the system will install a personal copy of the
        data, taken from the baseline, into that user's Roaming AppData
        directory. Any changes they make to the data will only be
        written to their private copy. If a new instance of AECHO is
        installed on the system, it will: update the baseline data to
        its refreshed version; overwrite the installing user's personal
        copy of the data immediately; overwrite each non-installing
        user's data when they first run the newly installed version of
        AECHO.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If a user wishes to make changes to a descriptive file, they can
      easily do so regardless of the type of AECHO installation. There
      are two buttons on the AECHO main form to assist in this:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Set

              Desc. Font</font></b></font> - this button sets all text
        in the currently displayed <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="AreaDescriptiveText.html"><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Descriptive Text Area</font></b></font></a>
        to AECHO's standard font-face (Verdana) and size (10 points.)
        All other formatting is preserved, such as coloration and
        text-styling. This command is useful if importing content from
        another source and it doesn't match existing text.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Save

              Desc.</font></b></font> - this button saves the current
        contents of the <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font
              size="-1">Descriptive Text Area</font></b></font> back to
        its source data file, overwriting the older content. Until
        saved, all changes are provisional, and may be easily (or
        accidentally!) discarded, as seen below.<br>
        <br>
        <table width="10%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="0"
          align="center">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td valign="top"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
                  src="Images/DescTextEditButtons.JPG" alt="Edit Buttons
                  for Descriptive Text" width="761" border="1"
                  height="609"><br>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr align="center">
              <td valign="top"><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font
                      size="-1">Descriptive Test Area</font></b></font>
                - Editing Buttons<br>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>AECHO overwrites the contents of the <font face="Helvetica,
        Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Descriptive Text Area</font></b></font>
      when navigating in a way that updates the current Section e.g.
      double-clicking in the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="AreaODF.html"><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
          sans-serif"><b>ODF Display Area</b></font></a> or using a <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="MenuBar.html"><font
          face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Menu-Bar</font></b></font></a>
      <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="MenuSections.html"><font
          face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Section</font></b></font></a>
      navigation choice, and that Section's content is not already on
      display. If the current Section changes for any reason, then the
      text content is always taken anew from the underlying Section data
      file. Usually, when staying in the same Section, the content is
      not refreshed, as it will already be on display. But not always,
      as the user may have issued a <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="MenuEditMode.html#List"><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
          sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">List Sections</font></b></font></a>
      command, causing different information to take over the <font
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Descriptive
            Text Area</font></b></font>, without having changed the
      current Section. The next ODF double-click in the same Section
      will cause AECHO to refresh the descriptive text, as it knows that
      the correct content is not on display.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If a user wishes to discard all changes made to a Section
      Description, but not yet saved, simply positioning to another
      Section will serve. Note that AECHO provides no warning that it is
      discarding unsaved changes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>At this time, there is no "undo" command. Modifications may be
      removed entirely (see the prior comment), or manually.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The procedure to change a Section's descriptive text is:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to the desired Section by either double-clicking on
        its content, or choosing it from the <font face="Helvetica,
          Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Menu-Bar</font></b></font>.
        This loads the current description into the <font
          face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Descriptive
              Text Area</font></b></font>.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>(Optional) Backup the current content by selecting the entire
        area, Ctrl+C to copy the formatted content, and then paste it
        into any RTF-aware program and save it from there into a file
        for safe-keeping.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Make desired alterations to the content, begin careful not to
        change Sections until after you have saved your new content. New
        content can be directly typed into the <font face="Helvetica,
          Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Descriptive Text Area</font></b></font>,
        or pasted in from other sources, such as prepared text
        maintained in an external, RTF-aware text editor.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>If the content is now what you want, commit it back to its
        underlying file by clicking on the <font face="Helvetica,
          Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Save Desc.</font></b></font>
        button; if not, you can discard it by simply navigating to a
        different Section.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
