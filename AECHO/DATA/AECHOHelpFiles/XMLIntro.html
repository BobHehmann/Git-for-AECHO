    XML (short for eXtensible Markup Language&gt; is a technology
    standard for encoding structured data as simple text, in a way that
    is universal, transportable, and technology independent. XML files
    are readable and editable by any common text-editing application,
    and are usable by any text-aware application. The representation of
    structure is an important element of XML - it provides a mechanism
    to simply express many ways of organizing and structuring data,
    including expressions that meaningfully translate back-and-forth
    between XML and modern databases. Hauptwerk ODFs are XML documents
    that follow a set of standards defined by HW that closely correlate
    with database concepts such as Tables, Records, and Fields.<br>
    <br>
    XML broadly places text into two categories: markup and data. Markup
    controls the identification of data, and gives it context and
    structure. Data is the raw informational content. Generally, in
    parts of an XML document that are not Data, extra white-space
    (blanks and tabs) and line-breaks placed between elements do not
    affect the interpretation. These extra characters may be used
    liberally to increase human readability. However, inside of Data, or
    within "quoted text" strings in Markup, white-space does matter, as
    it becomes a significant part of the Data or of the text-string.<br>
    <br>
    In the definitions below, single-quotes (') identify elements used
    in XML, the quotes separating them from their descriptive text.
    However, these single-quotes do not appear in actual XML - only the
    text between the quotes. In contrast, double-quotes (") are commonly
    used to delimit string-literals in XML, and when seen below, would
    carry forward exactly as seen into the real XML text.<br>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Tag</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      </dt>
      <dd> A markup string starting with '&lt;', and ending with '&gt;'.
        There are several types of Tags that are used in XML.<br>
        Example: '<code>&lt;ImaTag&gt;</code>'</dd>
      <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <dt><b>Start-Tag</b>:</dt>
      <dd>The opening tag of an Element e.g., '<code>&lt;Pitch&gt;</code>'.
        Contains the Element's Name immediately following the opening
        '&lt;'. Always paired with a a matching End-Tag.</dd>
      <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <dt><b>End-Tag</b>:</dt>
      <dd>The closing tag of an Element e.g., '<code>&lt;/Pitch&gt;</code>'.
        Contains the same Name as its paired Start-Tag, preceded by a
        forward-slash: '/'</dd>
      <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <dt><b>Name/Type</b>:</dt>
      <dd>The first token between the markup-brackets of a Tag: in the
        prior two examples, 'Pitch'. Names are case-sensitive. The Name
        of an Element identifies its Type, which can be associated with
        rules for acceptable syntax and structure of the Content within
        an Element of that particular Type. Names do not contain
        embedded white-space, as that would immediately terminate the
        Name; however, the underscore character ('_') can be used within
        a name to emulate a blank for clarity. For example, 'TwoWords'
        and 'Two_Words' are both valid (but different!) Names, while
        using 'Two Words' where a Name is required would be interpreted
        as the Name being 'Two'.<br>
      </dd>
      <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <dt><b>Element</b>:</dt>
      <dd>A string consisting of a Start-Tag ('<code>&lt;xyz&gt;</code>'),
        and ending with a matching End-Tag ('<code>&lt;/xyz&gt;</code>').
        There may or may not be text between a Start and End-Tag pair.</dd>
      <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <dt><b>Content</b>:</dt>
      <dd>The text found between an Element's Start and End-Tags; the
        Content may be null/empty. Content may include one or more
        nested Elements, in addition to Data text. Such nested Elements
        are called Child Elements, which are always wholly contained
        within their Parent Element. There may be one or more sibling
        Child Elements within their Parent's Content: if so, they appear
        one after the other, a successor Child's Start-Tag coming after
        its predecessor's End-Tag. White-space and line-breaks between
        siblings are acceptable but ignored, and may be freely
        introduced for clarity.<br>
        <br>
        Example: '<code>&lt;o&gt;&lt;a&gt;123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/o&gt;</code>'
        demonstrates a Parent (outer) Element 'o', whose Content
        consists of two Child Elements, 'a' and 'b'. The Content of
        Element 'a' is '123'; of 'b' is 'ABC'.<br>
        <br>
        Elements may be nested to any depth. Nested Elements must be
        wholly contained within their Parent's Content, and sibling
        Elements may never overlap. The rules for correct nesting are
        the same as seen in most hierarchical lists, such as in
        word-processors (multi-level lists) and programming languages
        (nesting of blocks.)<br>
        <br>
        Example: '<code>&lt;o&gt;&lt;a&gt;123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/o&gt;</code>'
        is OK (wholly nested), but '<code>&lt;o&gt;&lt;a&gt;123&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>'
        is incorrect, as the Parent 'o' cannot end before its Child 'a'
        ends. Similarly, '<code>&lt;o&gt;&lt;a&gt;123&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/o&gt;</code>'
        is syntactically correct, as the siblings 'a' and 'b' do not
        overlap, whereas '<code>&lt;o&gt;&lt;a&gt;123&lt;b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ABC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/o&gt;</code>'
        is incorrect, as the siblings are overlapped.</dd>
      <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <dt><b>Attribute</b>:</dt>
      <dd> Optional Name/Value pairs contained in a Start-Tag, following
        the Element's Name. Attributes are separated from the Element
        Name and from each other by white-space. Their syntax is '<code>attribute_name="attribute_value"
        </code>'. A Start-Tag may contain 0, 1, or more Attributes.<br>
        <br>
        Example: '<code>&lt;image source="picture.jpg"
          border="None"&gt;Stuff...&lt;/image&gt;</code>' is an Element
        named 'image' with two Attributes ('source' and 'border') whose
        values are respectively 'picture.jpg' and 'None'. The Content of
        'image' is 'Stuff...'.</dd>
      <dt><br>
      </dt>
      <dt><b>Analogs to Database Concepts</b>:</dt>
      <dd>The XML constructs used by HW in an ODF have very close
        correspondence to common database concepts. The outermost
        Elements define ODF Sections, directly analogous to database
        Tables. Almost every Section implements a "Record" structure,
        using 'o' Child Elements ('<code>&lt;o&gt;...&lt;/o&gt;</code>')
        to correspond one-to-one with database Records inside a Section
        Table. Inside these 'o' Elements, HW uses other Tag-Names to
        define the analog of database "Fields" within the Parent Record
        Element. The various Field Elements within a single Row/Record
        are sibling Children of the Parent Record Element; and the
        sibling Row Elements within a Section Element are the Children
        comprising that Parent Section.<br>
