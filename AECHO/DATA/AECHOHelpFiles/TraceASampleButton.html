    When positioned in the Sample Section, AECHO displays the <font
      size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Trace Sample</b></font>
    button, which in turn will open the <b>Sample Trace</b> form,
    automatically performing a Trace on the (sound) Sample currently
    selected in the ODF. Functionally, this is the same as selecting the
    menu item <b>menu &gt; </b><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
      sans-serif"><b><u>T</u></b></font><b><font size="-1"
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">ools</font> &gt; </b><font
      size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><u>T</u></b><b>race
        a Sample</b></font>, manually entering the Sample's ID, then
    clicking that form's <b><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
        sans-serif">Trace</font> </b>button. When the ODF is not
    positioned on a Sample Record, the <font size="-1" face="Helvetica,
      Arial, sans-serif"><b>Trace Sample</b></font> button is hidden.<br>
    <br>
    The <b>Sample Trace</b> form expands a Sample Record, listing all
    its defined Fields, both those present in the ODF and those not
    present. AECHO show the default values that Hauptwerk will
    implicitly use for
    absent Fields. Then Records from other Sections that are "linked" to
    this particular Sample are searched for, and if found, are displayed
    in the same expanded format as the Sample. The <b>Sample Trace</b>
    form can remain open while the main AECHO form is performing other
    activities, but is closed when AECHO terminates, or when the user
    closes the loaded ODF, as proper operation of Trace is tied to an
    ODF. The user can choose to close the form manually, by clicking on
    the <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>X</b></font> in
    the form's upper-right corner, or selecting the <b>menu &gt; <font
        size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">E</font></b><font
      size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><u>x</u></b><b>it</b></font>
    choice from Trace's menu-bar.<br>

      <dt>Example:</dt>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dd>In this example, the user has selected the second row in the
        Sample Section by double-clicking on it, loading it into the XML
        Row/Record Area, and decomposing its Fields into the Tags Panel.
        You'll note that the "&lt;a&gt;" Tag carries a value of "400497"
        - this is the SampleID, the unique primary-key assigned to this
        Sample Record. At the center-bottom of the Tags Panel, the <font
          size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Trace Sample</b></font>
        button was made visible by positioning on a Sample Record.
        Clicking this button will dispatch the <b>Sample Trace</b>
        form, passing it the SampleID of "400497", and then
        automatically initiating Trace on that Sample.</dd>
