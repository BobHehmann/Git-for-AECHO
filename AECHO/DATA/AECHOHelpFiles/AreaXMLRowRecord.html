    <a
href="file:///C:/Users/Bob%20Hehmann/source/repos/GIT-for-AECHO/AECHO/bin/Debug/net5.0-windows/DATA/AECHOHelpFiles/AECHOMain.htm"

    <br>
    When a Line is selected from the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="AreaODF.html"><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
        sans-serif"><b>ODF Display Area</b></font></a>, AECHO locates
    the entire Row surrounding that Line, and copies its contents into
    this display area.<br>
    <br>
    Rows may consist of one or more contiguous Lines. When an XML
    construct is bounded by '&lt;o&gt;...&lt;/o&gt;' Tags, it is
    considered to be a Record, and its Row is defined as all contiguous
    Lines starting with the one containing the opening '&lt;o&gt;' Tag,
    and ending with the Line containing the closing '&lt;/o&gt;' Tag.
    For all Lines that are not part of a Record, the Row is the same as
    the Line.<br>
    <br>
    This area will present a vertical scroll-bar if the display of the
    Row requires more than two lines of text. Unlike the ODF Display
    Area, the XML Row/Record Display Area will word-wrap long lines of
    text, as it does not have room for a horizontal scroll-bar.<br>
    <br>
    This area is read-only, but text may be freely selected and copied
    from it, suitable for pasting into any text editor.<br>
    <br>
    The following image demonstrates the display of a Record-Row
    consisting of three Lines. As this exceeds the vertical space
    allowed, the area made its vertical scroll-bar visible, to allow
    access to any part of the text. The user has selected the Field
    '&lt;f&gt;12&lt;/f&gt;' using a mouse-drag: this selection can now
    be Copied with a Ctrl-C, and later pasted into any program that
    accepts text.<br>
