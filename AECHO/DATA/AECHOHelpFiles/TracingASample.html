    The Sample Section enumerates all of the sound samples that the
    instrument has at its disposal. Each Record in this Section contains
    a minimal amount of data, usually three or four Fields: a SampleID,
    which is the unique Primary-key that identifies the sample
    throughout the rest of the ODF; the InstallationPackageID, which
    identifies of instrument that supplies the sound sample, which may
    be the ODF's own instrument, or another instrument altogether,
    allowing sounds to be borrowed; the directory path and filename of
    the sound sample, relative to the owning instrument's data
    directory; and less commonly, a tag that identifies License
    requirements for accessing the sample.<br>
    <br>
    Before sounding, HW applies extensive processing to render the
    actual output waveform to be sent to the internal mixer: attack,
    decay, tremulants, wind-effects... The information that defines
    these processes is mostly stored in other ODF Sections, being linked
    to the samples by shared key values, much like how relationships are
    modeled in relational databases. Sample Tracing provides a tool to
    help understand some of these primary relationships, by tracing
    several of these linkages and presenting related Records. For
    example, starting with a sample from the Sample Section, Trace will
    locate linkages to and render related Records for:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Attack (Section Pipe_SoundEngine01_AttackSample)</li>
      <li> Release (Section Pipe_SoundEngine01_ReleaseSample)</li>
      <li>Tremulant processing for the Fundamental Pitch (Section
        TremulantWaveform)</li>
      <li>Tremulant processing for the Third Harmonic (Section
        TremulantWaveform)</li>
      <li>The sample's Source Instrument (RequiredInstallationPackage)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A second difficulty in understanding how sound will be processed
      based on casual inspection of an ODF is caused by the extensive
      reliance upon implicit defaults. Several of the Sections named
      above are comprised of a great many Fields, but often their ODF
      Records only carry Tags for a small number of Fields: the rest are
      filled in by implicit default values, which are often significant
      to the processing. Compressed-ODFs do not contain references to
      these implicit, default-valued Fields. Tracing fills in these
      missing details, by presenting every possible Field defined for a
      particular Section's Records, and showing both explicitly defined
      Fields whose values are taken directly from the ODF, and implicit
      default values, supplied by HW internal logic when a given Field
      does not appear in a Record, or appears but is without a value.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There are two ways to access Sample Tracing: through the menu
      item <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="MenuTools.html#Tracing"><b>menu



          &gt; </b><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><u>T</u></b></font><b><font

        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="TraceASampleButton.html"><b>Trace Sample</b></a></font>
      button that is displayed whenever the selected Row/Record is a
      Sample Record. Both methods invoke the same <b>Sample Trace</b>
      form. They differ in that when the user invokes Tracing through
      the menu, the form's input field for <b>Sample ID</b> is
      initially blank, and the user is responsible for typing or pasting
      in the desired SampleID, then clicking the Trace form's <font
        size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Trace</b></font>
      button to initiate the Trace; when using the main form's <font
        size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Trace Sample</b></font>
      button, AECHO copies the SampleID from the current ODF record into
      the <b>Sample Trace</b> form's input field and initiates the
      Trace directly - saving keystrokes and reducing the chance
      entering the wrong SampleID.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The following screen snapshot show the impact of Trace. The
      Sample with SampleID "00497" was originally selected from the ODF.
      It contains a linkage with a Release Record, which has been
      subsequently selected, and is shown in the snippet below:<br>

            filename of the currently loaded ODF, and the Title "<b>Sample

            the form is cleared. The Blue and Green lines are the
            Sections, starting with the Sample itself (<font
              color="#3366ff">Blue</font>), followed by commonly linked
            Sections (<font color="#009900">Green</font>). Each Section
            is listed, along with its starting and ending Line Numbers
            in the ODF. If there are no Records within a Section that
            are linked with the Sample being Traced, the first indented
            line under the Section's header states this, in <font
              color="#cc0000">Red</font>: in the example, there are no
            related Attack Records. However, if there is a related
            Record in one of these Sections, then that Record's Fields
            are listed exhaustively. In this example, there is a related
            Release Record. The first indented line under Release tells
            us that the SampleID Field, defined by Tag "&lt;c&gt;", is
            present in the ODF, with a value of "400497". A few lines
            lower, it tells us that the Field
            LoadSampleRange_StartPositionValue, defined by Tag
            "&lt;e&gt;" is not present, so HW will use the default value
            of "0". Though scrolled off the example form's window, this
            sample went on to identify information regarding the two
            uses of Tremulants, and the source instrument package.
            Fields that explicitly appear in the ODF are displayed in
            Black, those that are not, and are therefore operating with
            default values, an in <font color="#996633">Brown</font>.<br>

            At any time, the user can enter another SampleID into the
            textbox, and initiate another Trace. The results of each
            subsequent Trace are appended to the bottom of the display,
            with a blank line separating Traces. Clicking the menu item
            <b>menu &gt; </b><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif"><b><u>C</u></b><b>lear Traces</b></font> will
            reset the display area to just its headers, showing the
            current ODF file that is loaded, and the Title "<b>Sample
              Trace</b>". The menu item <b>menu &gt; </b><font
              size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><u>P</u></b><b>rint


                Traces...</b></font> opens an operating-system standard
            print-dialog, allowing the user to print the entire contents
            of this forms content area, retaining all formatting. The
