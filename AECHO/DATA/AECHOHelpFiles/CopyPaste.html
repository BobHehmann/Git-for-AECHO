    <br>
    All four text-aware areas of AECHO's main form allow text selection
    at all times they contain content, highlighting the selection as it
    is made. Single, double, and in some case, triple mouse-clicks can
    all result in the selection of text (see <a moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="ManagingTheMouse.html">Managing the Mouse</a> for the exact
    behaviors). Also, all text-aware areas support the standard
    text-selection technique of "click-and-drag" with the mouse,
    allowing arbitrary regions of contiguous text to be selected.<br>
    <br>
    Once selected, text may be freely copied using the keyboard's Ctrl+C
    combination, copying the selected text, including any formatting,
    into the system's clipboard. From there, it may be pasted into any
    text-aware program that allows text-pasting, following the rules of
    that program. If the program understands Rich Text Formatting (RTF),
    the pasted content's formatting will be retained; if not, just the
    textual content will be pasted.<br>
    <br>
    Pasting into most AECHO text-areas is allowed by using the
    keyboard's Ctrl+V combination, but the rules differ slightly by
    area. When target-area content is already selected when the paste is
    issued, that content is deleted and replaced with the clipboard's
    content. If nothing is presently selected in the target area when
    pasting, then the clipboard's content is inserted into the target
    area at the Cursor/Caret's position. This behavior is the same as
    found in most editing programs.<br>
    <br>
    AECHO does not distinguish based on the origin of content to be
    pasted: it can come from within AECHO, or from any other program on
    the system. In all cases, a paste operation in AECHO is just taking
    its content from the system's clipboard, without caring how that
    content got there. In most cases, even Images can be successfully
    pasted into AECHO content. <br>
