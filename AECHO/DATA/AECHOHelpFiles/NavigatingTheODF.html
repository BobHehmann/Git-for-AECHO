    <br>
    ODFs can be quite large, sometimes 100,000+ lines and 10,000,000+
    characters long. AECHO provides several ways to navigate efficiently
    around the ODF Display Area.<br>
    <br>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Vertical Scroll-Bar</b></dt>
      <dd>The ODF Display Area is equipped with a vertical scroll-bar,
        which can be used to rapidly move from one end of the ODF to the
        other. Using the scroll bar never changes any aspect of the
        current location: Section, Row, and Cursor/Caret position remain
        unaffected.<br>
        <br>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Single Mouse-Click</b></dt>
      <dd>A single-click in the ODF repositions the Cursor/Caret to the
        point of the click, updating the Line and Row positions, but
        does not select the Row, nor change the current Section. <a

        <br>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Double Mouse-Click</b></dt>
      <dd>Like the single-click, the Cursor/Caret, Line, and Row
        positions are updated. Additionally, the double-click selects
        the entire Row, updating the XML Row/Record Area with the
        contents of the new Row, contextually updating the Tags Panel
        Area, and updating the current Section, including its
        descriptive text. <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="ManagingTheMouse.html">Click here to learn more</a>.<br>
        <br>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Menu-Bar Section Items</b></dt>
      <dd>Every Section is directly accessible through the Menu-Bar:
        choosing a Section this way is the equivalent of double-clicking
        on the Section's Start-Tag (Title Line). <a
          moz-do-not-send="true" href="MenuSections.html">Click here to
          learn more</a>.<br>
        <br>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Text Searching</b></dt>
      <dd>AECHO supports text searches both forward and backward from
        the current position, or forward from the beginning of the ODF.
        When successful, a search behaves similar to a single-click,
        repositioning the Cursor/Caret, Line, and Row without selecting
        that Row or updating the Section. It leaves the newly located
        text selected. <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="AreaSearch.html">Click
          here to learn more</a>.<br>
        <br>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Line Positioning</b></dt>
      <dd>The current Line can be incremented or decremented by 1, 10,
        or 100 lines by a single button-click. Positioning this way is
        the equivalent of double-clicking on the beginning of the new
        Line. <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="ButtonsNextPrevLine.html">Click
          here to learn more</a>.<br>
        <br>
      </dd>
      <dt><b>Markers (Bookmarks)</b></dt>
      <dd>Up to four bookmarks may be set at one time using any of the
        four <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font
              size="-1">Marker</font></b></font> buttons. Selecting a
        set <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font
              size="-1">Marker</font></b></font> is the equivalent of
        single-clicking on the first character of the bookmarked Line. <a
