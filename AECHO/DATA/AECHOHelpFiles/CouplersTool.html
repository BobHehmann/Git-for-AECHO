    Hauptwerk encodes three pieces of information into a single 4-digit
    integer when representing a Coupler's function:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The Source: the Keyboard/Division that will be sounded when a
        Destination Key is pressed. The Source can be the Pedals and
        Manuals 1 through 6;</li>
      <li>The Destination: the Keyboard that, when operated, will cause
        the Source Keyboard/Division to follow. The Destination can be
        the Pedals and Manuals 1 through 6;</li>
      <li>The Type: defines the pitch relationship of the Source
        relative to the Destination e.g., if Type = 16 ft., the Source
        will sound an octave lower than the Destination key that is
        depressed. The allowable Coupler Types are 16, 8, and 4 foot,
        Unison-Off, Bass (sound from the Source only the lowest note
        being played on the Destination Keyboard), and Melody (sound
        from the Source only the highest note being played on the
        Destination Keyboard);<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hauptwerk assigns the same internal value to the two Types "8 ft.
      (Unison)" and "Unison Off". If the Source and Destination are the
      same, Hauptwerk will treat this single internal Type value as
      representing "Unison Off"; if they are different, the Type will be
      interpreted as being an intra-manual "8 ft. (Unison)" coupling.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The Couplers form translates bi-directionally between Hauptwerk's
      internal Coupler-Codes and the functions those Codes represent. To
      translate a Code into its Functional representation, the user
      enters the 4-digit Code into the textbox at the center-top of the
      form, then presses their Enter-key: AECHO will decode the integer,
      setting the radio-buttons to represent the Code's functional
      meaning (or display a warning message if the Code is invalid.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>Conversely, to encode a Function, the user sets the radio-buttons
      for each of the three categories, then clicks the <font size="-1"
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Find Code</b></font>
      button: AECHO will calculate the correct encoding, and display the
      resulting 4-digit number in the textbox at the center-top of the
      form. If the radio-button combination is invalid e.g., choosing
      the same Source &amp; Destination while selecting the Type "8 ft.
      (Uni)", AECHO will display a warning.<br>
    </p>
    <p>To close the Couplers form, click the <b><font face="Helvetica,
          Arial, sans-serif">X</font></b> control at the upper-right
      corner of the form's window.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Examples: the first example, on the left, shows the result of
      entering the Code "1101" and then typing the Enter-key: this Code
      represent a Pedal to Manual-1 8' coupler. The second example, on
      the right, show the conversion of the Coupler Manual-2 Unison Off
      to its code "1211".<br>
