    XML (short for eXtensible Markup Language&gt; is a technology
    standard for encoding structured data as simple text, in a way that
    is universal, transportable, and technology independent. XML files
    are readable and editable by any common text-editing application,
    and are usable by any text-aware application. The representation of
    structure is an important element of XML - it provides a way to
    simply express many ways of organizing and structuring data,
    including expressions that meaningfully translate back-and-forth
    between XML and modern databases. Hauptwerk ODFs are XML documents
    that follow a set of standards defined by HW that closely correlate
    with database concepts such as Tables, Records, and Fields.<br>
