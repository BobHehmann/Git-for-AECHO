    <br>
    The <font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>Descriptive
        Text Area</b></font> is predominantly used to display the
    descriptive text for the current Section. It is also used to display
    the <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Sections
          List</font></b></font> (upon first loading an ODF, and
    subsequently on-demand), and occasionally used to display AECHO's
    Short-Form Help Text, if the Help HTML is unavailable.<br>
    <br>
    The contents of this area can be sent to any system printer,
    physical or virtual, using <b>menu &gt; <font size="-1"
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><u>F</u>ile</font> &gt; <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="MenuFile.html"><font size="-1"
          face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><u>P</u>rint Descriptive
          Text...</font></a></b> Contextually appropriate headers will
    be added to the top of the first printed page, and all formatting
    (font type, size, weight, color...) will be honored in the output.<br>
    <br>
    The font-face and size of text displayed in this area can be
    standardized by clicking the <font size="-1" face="Helvetica,
      Arial, sans-serif"><b>Set Desc. Font</b></font> button. This
    function preserves all other format attributes, such as bold,
    italic, underlined, and color. This button acts immediately upon the
    text currently displayed in the area, but has no ongoing effect if
    the content is reloaded. This command can be useful when pasting in
    content taken from other sources, that may use different font
    styles.<br>
    <br>
    Text is this area is selectable, and can be freely cut and then
    pasted into other programs. It can also be freely edited, or content
    copied from elsewhere can be pasted into the area. Any such
    modifications will appear if the area is printed. While
    modifications to the Short-Form Help Text are transient, being
    overwritten the next time the text is displayed, changes to Section
    descriptive text can be permanently saved. The <font
      face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><font size="-1">Save Desc.</font></b></font>
    button will save Section-specific content back to the file system,
    allowing a user to customize their content. Note that such changes
    could be overwritten by AECHO's default content if the application
    is reinstalled or updated in the future.<br>
    <br>
    The most common use of this area is to display the selected
    Section's descriptive text: this text lists all known Field Tags for
    the current Section (based on Hauptwerk V6.x specifications),
    showing their short-form abbreviated Tag-Names as seen in the
    Compressed-ODFs that AECHO works with, alongside their expanded
    Tag-Names as seen in a Full-ODF or in a database representation of
    an ODF. When defined, default values for the Fields are included -
    these are the values that HW fills in for an optional Field that is
    currently defined in the HW specification, but that does not appear
    in an ODF Record. Note that not all optional Fields have defined
    default values. Below the Fields that are presently in use, the
    descriptive text lists deprecated Tags, along with the HW version
    where they became obsolete. Obsolete Tags are simply ignored by
    Hauptwerk.<br>
    <br>
    Upon initially loading an ODF, and subsequently on-demand using the
    command <b>menu &gt; </b><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial,
      sans-serif"><b><u>E</u></b></font><b><font size="-1"
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">dit Mode</font> &gt; </b><a
      moz-do-not-send="true" href="MenuEditMode.html"><font size="-1"
        face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><u>L</u></b><b>ist
          Sections</b></font></a>, the ODF is scanned from start to
    finish, and the area displays each Section's Number, Starting &amp;
    Ending Line Number, Starting &amp; Ending Character Position, and
    its Name.<br>
    <br>
    If for some reason AECHO cannot open the extended HTML Help Text, it
    falls-back to displaying the Short-Form Help Text in this area.<br>
