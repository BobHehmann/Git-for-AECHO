1.058.2 Baseline Vesion
    Git:        NA
    Summary:    Code as initially received from Jean-Paul V.
    Details:    NA

1.059.0     April, 07-2021   Bob Hehmann
    Git:        master
    Summary:    Minor spelling/text changes; added UTF-8 compatability; About Box; Loaded into Git; .NET from 3.5 to 4.8
    Details:

    1)  Updated Version to 1.059, updated copyright date, corrected version number in Window Title Bar & About Box
    2)  Changed ODF I/O to allow UTF-8 compatibilty, useful if including special/extended characters, i.e. adding an
        umlaut to a Stop Name
    3)  Changed "Compilated" to "Compiled" in Title Bar; Made Vesion info in Title Bar & About Box dynamic
    4)  Changed Menu Bar text to mixed-case, added ... to "Save As" & "Open Hauptwerk Organ"; Changed text for
        "Help" to "View Help", "About" to "About AECHO", reflecting standatd practice
    5)  Replaced MSgBox implementation of "About" with VS AboutBox object, which takes its content from Project
        Assembly parameters.
    6)  Updated .NET Framework from 3.5 to 4.8 (and tested successfully with .NET 5.0)
    7) 	Added AECHO 1.059.0 Project to GIT, to manage source versioning. Updates 1-7 define the initial baseline
        Git Branch 'master'

1.060.0     April 18, 2021  Bob Hehmann
    Git:        cleanup-InitialPass-Syntax-Comments
    Summary:    Improve in-code documentation; added \DATA to Git management; remove IDE Warnings; formatting
    Details:

    1)  Cleanup code formatting, comment formatting,
        resolved all IDE Warnings and Informational messages.
    2)  Add English comments to all code.
    3)  Add standardized documentation to all procedures: Purpose; Process; Called-By; Side-Effects; Notes
    4)  Add XML terminology, will relate to new XML-specific logic to be added soon.
    5)  Modified "Exit Sub" to "Return" (avoids IDE editing/auto-complete issues.)
    6)  Added ability to locate the "\DATA" directory from 2 locations: the ususal location, adjacent to
        the executable, for use when AECHO is not explicitly installed; from a distinct non-adjacent synthetic
        directory, when installed as a Click-once application. For Click-once apps, Windows moves data files to
        a non-adjacent area, need to use a system call to locate.
    7)  Added the \DATA directory to the project, maintained at the same level in the VS Proejct as the Project
        file and VB sourcecode - this places it under Git version management. Added to installer, so correct version
        is created via Publish. To use with non-Published versions, copy this master to the usual adjacent location,
        from Windows.
    8)  Made Publication-ready in Visual Studio.

1.060.1     April 18, 2021 Bob Hehmann
    Git:        NET5-Upgrade
    Summary:    Upgrade to .Net 5.0; Added Windows Installer Project; Modified \DATA locator to support  both installed
                and unintstalled variants.
    Details:

    1)  Upgrade from .NET 4.8 to .NET 5.0
    2)  Added an installer project, so AECHO can run from a self-contained directory (legacy), or be installed as a
        standard application. When installing, \DATA dir is placed into "\User\Romaing\Aecho\DATA". Installer will
        install the code, place the \DATA directory under \Roaming\, create desktop icon, and a Program Start-Menu
        entry. Includes Uninstalling capability (removes code, data, icon, and Start-Menu folder/icon.)
    3)  Added code to locate the \DATA directory either adjacent to the executable (legacy), or in its installed location.

1.060.2     April 20, 2021 Bob Hehmann
    Git:        Code-Cleanup2
    Summary:    Deeper clean, remove many side-effect; bug fixes; standardized naming conventions; no-wrap ODF display.
    Details:

    1)  Detailed code clean-up, minor functionality. Move most contants to Global Constants in Main Form; reduce reliance on
        global variables and side-effects; standardize error handling and messaging; Rename some objects to reflect their
        function rather than just their VB Type e.g. "Rtb_ODF" rather than "RTBox". Harden routines; catch key Exceptions.
        Overall flow and algorithms stay close to the original. Added "Updates" to the standardized Routine Documentation Header.

    2)  Moved some controls, adjusted sizes, normalized display fonts. Added code to remember the standard size of the
        Tags Panel, and to calculate its expanded size when it is upscaled to display an image. Rather than hardcoding the
        two sizes, save the initial size and calculate the expanded size to align to the right-side of Descriptive Text Panel.
        This allows those panels to be re-sized at design time, and the code will still work unchanged. Added Titles to these
        Panels.

    3)  Set No-Wrapping attribute of Rtb_ODF, so the XML/ODF display never introduces soft line-breaks - it uses a horizontal
        scroll-bar instead. This helps stabilize Line Numbers i.e. changing the ODF Font Size no longer changes line
        numbering or total line count. Widened the control, to show more text without scrolling.

    4)  Moved this detailed Change Log out of the Main Source Code into its own file: ChangeLog.txt, under Git control. Moved
        bulk internal documentation out of code, into its own Git-managed file: GeneralNotes.txt.

    5)  Make initialization explicit, setting initial, no-ODF loaded state, both at startup, and after successfully selecting
        an ODF file to load. Most logic is implemented in new routine ResetToNoODF(). Introduced G_HasODFChanged global to track
        if we should prompt to save a modified file before opening a new ODF or Quiting, or should we just discard the changes.
        Set default font size for Rtb_ODF to match the numeric font-size Control's default, avoiding conversion upon load.

    6)  Created "Deprecated_Unused_Code.txt" file under Git control, relocated old, unused routines from active Modules to
        there. Kept around, as they may embody useful ideas from prior releases or versions.
            OldGetSectionFromMenu()                             <Replaced by newer algorithm>
            GetFirstLine()                                      <Only referenced by OldGetSectionFromMenu()>

    7)  Alter Title-Text over the Descriptive Text Box (Section Descriptions, Help Text, Section Locations) based on the context.

    8)  Initialize Coupler-Code form to have 1 pre-checked Radio Button in each of the three categories. Move values of the
        choices into the .Tag properties of the Radio Buttons, eliminating long If-then chains. For "Find-Code", ensure that with
        Unison-Off, Source & Destination are the same, and for 8 ft./Unison, that they are different - warn user if this is violated.
        Added code to validate a manually entered Coupler Code before altering the buttons: 4 digit numberic, each component in-bounds.
        Provide explicit error message if this is invalid. Shorten logic to detect Uni-Off vs 8 ft.

    9)  Add Menu option to Close the current ODF (prompts to save if content was modified, otherwise just cleans-up.) Added error
        trapping to SaveAs, to catch failure to write out the data. If Closing, Quiting, or Opening a new ODF,
        and there is a current loaded ODF that has been modified since opening or saving last, prompt user to SaveAs.

    10) Added roll-over tool-tip text to all menu choices. Added Shortcuts to common items. Added "Alt" accessible single-key
        codes to every item except SEction choice sub-items. Moved SectionNames from Constants to .Tag content for each Section
        Menu Item, and reduced all Section Sub-Menu processing to a single subroutine (instead of 44), that takes the Section
        Name from the Tag. Eliminated the 44 Constants (Strings), one for each Section, holding its expanded Element Name.

            Menu Item                       Shortcut
            File						    <None>
	            Open Hauptwerk Organ...		Ctrl-O
	            Close ODF				    Ctrl-W
	            Save As...				    Ctrl-Alt-S
                Print Descriptive Text...   Ctrl-P
	            Exit					    Alt-F4
            Sections (A) 1-22				<None>
            Sections (B) 23-44				<None>
            Edit Mode					    <None>

            Tools						    <None>
	            Clear Markers				<None>
	            Couplers (Encode/Decode)	<None>

	            View Help				    Ctrl-F1
	            About AECHO				    F1

    11) When coloring Section Titles (on load, on recompute), fixed off-by-one error that didn't alter the final character. 
        Set the Title's font size to 1pt more than the current normal text setting. When initially loading an ODF, use
        the current font-size setting, rather than a fixed 10 pt default. Changed overall Font to Arial from MS Sans, for
        improved scaling when changing ODF font size. Also changed XML Rows and Tag Displays to Arial 10 Regular.

    12) After loading a new ODF, position to the "DisplayPage" Section by default. Init the Start/End/Line#/Position values;
        displaying them in country-correct numerical form e.e (USA 1,234,567 rather than 1234567.)

    13) Consolidated the three AdvanceByN (1, 10, 100) Events into a single Routine, taking the # of lines to advance
        from the activated Button's .Tag property. Eliminated the routine NextLineCommun, as all code is now in one place. Support
        bi-directional movement: Previous Line, 10 Lines, 100 Lines.

    14) Fixed feature where resizing the display font of the ODF would remove the special emphasis formatting that had been applied
        to Section Titles when they were first parsed. Introduced new routine setRTBFontSize that can (optionally) scan for
        and re-apply the relative emphasis used for ODF titles. This routine can operate on any RTB Control.

    15) Warn gracefully if an ODF has too many Sections (presently must be <=44), to prevent index-out-of-bounds error during
        Section parsing. Note that user editing could introduce such as error in real-time, cannot rely upon an industrial
        ODF that is well-formed.

    16) Fixed bug where displaying the Help File or doing a "silent" recompute would not change the application's memory of what
        was displayed in the Descriptive Text box - going back to the same Section as just before the Help/ReCompute request would
        fail to update the Section Description text, as AECHO would believe the correct text was already on display.
        Added more robust messaging if correct .RFT file or its default backup cannot be found.

    17) Made Title transitions over the Descriptive Text Box more robust, painting/repainting the correct Titles for each AECHO
        state. Implemented optional 2-line titles. For the default and Help titles, 1 line (bottom) is displayed centered over the
        box. The Section Load & Section Display modes place the main title centered on the top line, and display a column-oriented
        legend left-justified on the bottom line. Section Load data is presented in a more regualr column format, and Section
        Descriptive Text has been rewritten to line up with its legend.

    18) Line numbers were often displayed "off-by-one", as many VB functions are zero-based, not 1-based - therfore the line index
        of the first line in an RTB Control is "0". Resolved this, displaying 1-based numbers. Lode correct Line Start/End &
        Caret Position when initially positioning to the Section DisplayPage upon initial ODF file load.

    19) For Image File Display: only present the "DisplayImage" button when there is an actionable image file in the current Row
        (avoids accessing an incorrect image file); explicitly retain the index to Section "ImageSet" in S_Section, using
        G_ImageSetIndex (rather than assume it is always 5); improve parsing of ImageSet and ImageSetElement Rows, to remove
        assumption that Tags appear in a pre-determined order (original code assumes <c>...</c> always appears after <a>...</a>,
        which is not required.) Altered FindImagePackageID() and DisplayImage() to accept all globals as parameters, removing
        direct reference to globals from code. Eliminated use of intermediate bitmap, loading Image Files directly into the
        Pbox Control. Changed RTB Tag searches in FindImagePackageID() from .None to .NoHighlight, for execution speed.

    20) When loading a .rtf file, such as a Section's Descriptive Text, removed the code that forced the font to Verdana 10pt, as
        this also removes other formatting associated with the Font.Style property - such as bolding and underlining (color is
        preserved, as that is a different attribute in a Rich Text Box.) This allows richer formatting of the text using an outside
        .rtf-aware text editor. Modified the "Set Fonts" button to processed the RTB one character at a time, which allows forcing
        the Font to Verdana 10, while retaining other attributes - but this is slow, and visible on the screen: OK for the "Set
        Fonts" Button, but not for real-time loading of a .rtf file in response to clicking on ODF text. Rewrote LoadRTFFile()
        as a Function, whose input parameters are the read-only globals, and that returns the path/filename of the loaded file.

    21) Enable/Disable the "Set Font" and "Save Description" buttons based on the present content of the Descriptive display
        box: allow those functions when Section Descriptive Text is on display, disable them when the RTB control is
        empty, displaying Section Parsing Data (upon initial ODF load), or Help File content. Tightened logic for remembering
        what, if anything, is currently displayed, and eliminated global G_RTFFile, while retaining G_PreviousRTFFile. Added
        exception handlers to Load/Save RTF_Descr and Load Help File routines.

    22) Changed all forward text searches, regardless of source RTB Contol, to use FindMyTag(), a more generalized version of
        the original FindMyText(). Moved FindMyText() out of the program, into Deprecated_Unused_Code.txt.

    23) Updated the content of the Section-Description .rtf files. Completed all fields; updated to HW6.02 definitions; corrected
        typos; added content for deprecated fields (tag, name, deprecated as of HW version); standardized format, and introduced
        tab alignment of columns; standardized use of color, bolding, and underlining. First line: "Section: <SectionName>". All
        bold, "Section" in black, "Name" in blue. All field definitions in regular black font. Title line for obsoleted tags in
        red, bold, underlined font. When a Tag's shortcut is unknown, "?" is used, over a yellow background to highlight.

    24) Added Previous 1, 10, and 100 Line repositioning Buttons to match the existing +1, 10, and 100. Reworked repositioning
        logic to eliminate bugs, to explicitly stay inbounds, and to retain accuracy in displayed position info (Line, Cursor...)

    25) Consolidated functions of ClearTagsPanel() and ShowTagsPanel() into a single routine with a boolean parameter to
        control visibility: TagsPanelVisible(). Renamed modified ClearTagsPanel() to this new name, retired ShowTagsPanel()
        to Deprecated_Unused_Code.txt.

    26) Removed all references to unused global variables: G_StartPos; G_EndPos; G_SectionStart; G_SectionEnd; G_Section; G_LastSectionName
        G_ItemToFollow. Converted a number of global variables to locals or constants, or eliminated then: G_MainTitle; G_CaretPos; G_AppPath;
        G_TextToFind; G_FindStartPos; G_RowText.

    27) Modified FindText functions to perform FindNext/Prev continuing from the +/-1 from the last successful search if the cursor hasn't moved, 
        or from the cursor's position if it has moved. This allows the user to click or otherwise change position to an arbitrary location, 
        and continue a FindNext or FindPrev from that spot. On success, cursor is to the right of the located text, not the left.
        If text is not found, leave the cursor visible, from the point the search started. No longer clears the XML Row/Record, Tags Panel, 
        or Descriptive Text; leaves Section Title unaltered: now similar to single Mouse-click semantics.

    28) Recolored the "Edit Mode" Menu choice to show the standard "Gainsboro" background color when in its default, read-only mode; retained
        the Red highlight when editing is enabled. Modified the "ODF Editing Enabled" and "ODF Editing Disabled" submenu choices to act as a
        toggle, with the checked option disabled: this prevents irrelevant warnings and actions when accidently selecting the mode that is
        already set. When exiting Edit-Mode, only solicit a ReCompute if something was actually changed in the ODF since entering Edit-Mode,
        and the Sections have not been recomputed already since the change. Removed the Recompute warning when entering Edit-Mode, and shortened
        it when recommending a Recompute upon leaving Edit-Mode.

    29) When positioning onto a Line, decode the Row-Type, and display the type on the Status-Bar. When in Edit-Mode, do not reset the cursor
        to the beginning of the Line, just leave it at the click-point.

    30) Modified GetSectionByName from a subroutine to a function that returns the Section Name. Eliminated any reference inside this function
        to G_SectionName, and removed screen-update of Name: that is now the caller's responsibility. Function returns the dynamic location
        of the Section's Start and End.

    31) Corrected the parsing of Record Rows (<o>...</o>), these can now be comprised of any number of adjacent Lines - the actual Start and End
        Tags are searched for, without assumptions. If an extended Start or exetended End is not found, the present Line's value is used instead.
        Navigation is now allowed to anywhere in the ODF, and any text can be double-clicked. The correct Row content is isolated and handled
        properly, including the _General Section, and extra-Sectional content, such as Headers and Trailers.

    32) Added the _General Section to the Menu-Bar, as it can now be displayed safely. Added a Descriptive .rtf file, code as a "virtual" Section
        named "None".

    33) In new Status-Bar, indicate the Row-type of the line we have positioned to. Provide a File-Dirty indicator: dark-orange when there is no
        ODF loaded; green when the current loaded ODF has a copy as a file; red when the ODF has been modified but not saved.

    34) Correctly handle single and double-clicks while in either the header (content before _General), or the trailer (content after the last
        </ObjectList> Tag). Treat these as psudo-Section "None". Content can be copied to the XML Row, but is not parsed. "None" Section's
        Descriptive .rtf is displayed when expected. When in the header area, Section Start is 0 (opening of ODF), End is end of last line before _General
        Section begins. If in the trailer area, Setion Start and end will be computed as the Start/End of all content after the final normal
        Section closing Tag.

    35) Markers modified to operate on Line Numbers, rather than character positions. Left-clicking an active Marker simulates a single Mouse-click
        at the left edge of the marked Line, updating Line Number, Cursor Position, Line Start/End, & Row Start-End. It does not update section content,
        nor does it extract Tag content or alter the Descriptive Text area.

    36) Made the position data fields hotlinks: Line Number; Cursor Position; Section Start; Sectio End; Line Start; Line End; Row Start; Row End.
        If these is no ODF loaded, these are disabled. Line Number will position to the beginning of the referenced Line.
        
    37) Added modern HTML-style Help. HTML assets are stored in \DATA\AECHOHelpFiles. On startup, AECHO checks if the directory exists - if not, it
        falls-back to the old-style Help for the remainder of this executio. If the directory exists, Help attempts to load AECHOMain.HTM in the
        default browser, to fulfill a View Help request. If this succeeds, we're done. If that file does not exists, or another exception triggers
        while attempting to find/load the HTML help, AECHO warns the user, and falls back to the old-style Help.

    38) Eliminated all use of ReCompute & the related S_Sections data-structure array. Instead, all required navigation information is retrieved
        dynamically. The Edit Mode->ReCompute menu item has been replaced with "List Sections", which populates the Descriptive Text area with the
        same information as the old ReCompute, but this no longer build/rebuilds any useful internal data. The "silent recompute" of the Led button
        is no longr implmented. Entering and Leaving Edit-Mode no longer warns about nor solicits a ReCompute. AECHO no longer tracks if ODF
        data has been changed by editing since a ReCompute, though it does track changes since the last save-to-a-file.

    39) Rewrote Trace-Sample, eliminating Find_a_Tag() and Read_a_Tag(): instead, use the new Function ReadAndDisplayTag() that combines those
        two routines plus managing the output. Use direct RTB.Find() method invocations for misc. searches. Relocated from the Follow Form to
        SharedCode. Added Default Value info for missing or null-content Fields. Completed logic for Sample Section, and relationally-linked
        Sections Pipe_SoundEngine01_AttackSample, PipeSoundEngine01_ReleaseSample, TremulantWaveform (both foreign-key linkages), and 
        RequiredInstallationPackage. Widened both Form and ListBox, and added horizontal scrolling to the ListBox. Use new function 
        LocateRecRowByKey() to standardize searches for any Row in any Section based on a Record Key Value. Added "Trace Sample" button
        to Record-Row display when in the Sample Section - when the parsed row contains a SampleID, the "Trace Sample" button appears - clicking
        it will open the Trace-Sample form, transfer the SampleID to the form, and invoke Trace.

    40) Established a separate Module (SharedCode.vb) for shared Functions and Subroutines, moving them out of the Main Form's
        own code. Reduced naming scope of declarations from "Public" to "Friend". (See end of this doc for list of routines.)

1.060.3     March 23, 2021 Bob Hehmann
    Git:        Printing
    Summary:    Implemented formatted Print function for the Descriptive Text area, and the Sample Trace form.
    Details:    Created an enhanced RTB control, inheriting the standard Rich Text Box, augmenting it with methods to pass print-rendering
                off to the Win32 API, which can correctly render a formatted RTB for printing. Enhancements are coded in a new Class,
                RTBPrint: code structure courtesy of Martin Mueller 1/18/2008 article for Microsoft. Modified standard print logic to
                invoke the new formatter.

    1)  Added Print function, to print contents of the Descriptive Text Box (Section Info, Section Descriptions). Creates a hidden RBTPrint
        control (Rtb_DTExt), and copies formatted text over from the Rtb_DescText control, adding appropriate headers. It then invokes the enhanced
        print formatting of the new control to render the content to any printer.

    2)  Modified "\DATA\initial.txt" file, removing the quotation marks from the string defining the default ODF directory path - the existence of
        these quotes causes AECHO to take a system default directory, rather than use the contents of the initial.txt file.

    3)  Updated fallback-Help file (help.rtf) to accurately reflect the complete functionality.

    4)  Always close the Sample Trace form when initializing to "No ODF". Note that this does not require knowing if Trace is open, no exception is
        thrown either way. Renamed the form & vb code to from "Follow" to "Trace", for consistency.

    5)  Support formatted printing of Trace Data. Changed out the form's List Box with an enhanced RTB for printing, and aligned parameter types
        in routines that passed these controls around. Changed .Item.Add method to .AppendText, and appended Cr/Lf to ends of lines. Added blank
        line at end of a Trace, for visual separation. Added a menu bar to the Trace form, with Exit (close form), Clear Traces (reset the 
        Trace display area to blank), and Print Traces... (formatted printing of the Trace display area.) Color coded the output, and improved
        indentation.

    6)  Worked around ancient RTF bug, where an RTB enables AutoWordSelection when the form is first loaded, even though this property is disabled
        in the Designer. Disabled this for the all visible RTBs with code the the forms' Load Events, so text selection in XML strings works as
        expected. Otherwise the forms keep auto-extending text selections made with a mouse when crossing tag boundaries - can't select between
        '><' on both sides of the same selection: one far side of the drap will also autoselect past the first bracket encountered.


1.060.4     June 1, 2021 Bob Hehmann
    Git:        Printing
    Summary:    Add the current loaded ODFs Line & Char counts to the Status-Bar
    Details:    Added Title and Value Fields to the Status-Bar, initialization code into ResetToNoODF(). Set initial values in
                Menu_OpenHauptwerkOrgan_Click. Update from TextChanged Event for Rtb_ODF.

    1)          Added the controls and code.

    2)          Published significant updates to the HTML Help Text - almost all baseline pages are up to at least draft form.



Routines relocated from forms to shared.vb (or new routines created in shared.vb):

Friend              Constant Declarations / Init    <Relocated from MAIN form>
Friend              Global Variable Declarations    <Relocated from MAIN form>
